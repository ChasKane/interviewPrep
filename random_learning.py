# # Counter.most_common(n) returns the n most common items in a list
# # in decreasing order of occurance, formated as a list of tuples in
# # the format (item, frequency)

# # nlargest/nsmallest from heapq each return the n largest/smallest elements
# # in the iterable you give them, in decreasing/increasing order respectively.
# # as with sorted, you can give it a key (function to call on each item once in
# # the iterable, which can be used to grab a value from a key if you're trying to
# # sort a list of dicts by a specific value
# import heapq
# a = [5,1,3,7,9,0,-4,-5,-6,-2,4,2,0,8]

# # lists can be unpacked

# # so can iterables

# # so can dicts

# random question a student asked me a fascinating question in office hours:
# write a single recursive function that takes 2 numbers and returns their
# product without using mult/div ops or anything like that. Recursion has to be
# the main method of madness here. note a and b can be negative.
# def mN(a, b):
#     print(a, b)
#     if a == 0 or b == 0:
#         return 0
#     if a > 0 and b > 0: return a + mN(a, b)
#     if a > 0 and b < 0: return a - mN(a, b)
#     if a < 0 and b > 0: return a - mN(a, b)
#     if a < 0 and b < 0: return a + mN(a, b)
# print(mN(4, 3))
# print(mN(4, -3))
# print(mN(-4, 3))
# print(mN(-4, -3))
